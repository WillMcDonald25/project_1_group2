Uber Data Analysis
Data analysis based on Uber ride data available on Kaggle and the Open Weather API to
investigate whether there is a relationship between these three variables:

● Temperature and the number of Uber rides
● Cost and the number of Uber rides
● Type of weather and the number of Uber rides

Our main focus is on Uber rides that took place in New York City between 2009 and
2015. Worked with a dataset of 200,000 Uber rides, but for the purpose of our research
questions, we randomly selected a sample of 500 rides.

Hypothesis: If inclement weather is present in the environment then
there will be a higher influx of Uber rides.
How does the temperature affect the total number of Uber
rides?

According to our data, there appears to be a correlation between ideal temperature and
increased Uber usage. However, the statistical analysis is somewhat ambiguous. This
could be due to certain anomalies in the data that were not initially detected due to
limitations during the code creation and debugging process, particularly when we
attempted with a smaller data set.

How does the type of weather affect total uber rides/drivers?

Based on the data collected, there seems to be a potential correlation between
unfavorable weather conditions and a decrease in Uber ridership. However, there may
be several unexplored variables that could have influenced this trend.

How does the type of weather affect the number of passengers?

The data suggests a correlation between poor weather conditions and a decrease in
Uber usage. Additionally, there appears to be a strong relationship between cost and the
number of passengers, which may be attributed to outliers in the cost data.
As a result of development constraints, this data only displays the maximum number of
passengers and maximum cost for each type of weather. Although our intention was to
calculate the total figures, we were unable to do so due to the small size of the dataset,
resulting in the oversight of this bug.

conclusion

In summary, Upon examining our initial hypothesis, the data we analyzed did not
support it. However, there are several factors that may have influenced this outcome,
such as the limited sample size of the data we analyzed. Additionally, we faced time
constraints during the analysis process, and the initial dataset we had was unusable,
which may have impacted our findings. The assumptions we made with a small sample
size of 5 could differ significantly from those made with a larger sample size of 500.
Furthermore, the early stages of the data collection coincide with the inception of Uber
which could introduce outliers in the data.
